# Spectral History Compression (Exploratory)

This repository contains an early exploratory experiment on compressing
temporal history in a non-stationary setting using spectral summaries.

## Context
In many non-stationary systems, naive approaches stack raw history to
approximate Markovian state, leading to high-dimensional inputs.

This experiment asks whether coarse spectral summaries can act as a
low-dimensional proxy for history.

## What This Is
- A minimal, toy experiment
- Largely exploratory
- Used to probe representation ideas

## What This Is Not
- A polished method
- A complete understanding
- A validated research claim

## Files
- `experiment.ipynb` — original Colab notebook

## Status
Archived exploratory work. Kept for continuity and learning.
